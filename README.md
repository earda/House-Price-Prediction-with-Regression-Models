# House-Price-Prediction with Regression Models

## Regression ( Linear, Lasso, Ridge, Multivarient )

Spyder and Jupyter are used in Python language.

Spyder 1- verial.py is run. The attributes of the house prices for sale are drawn from Sahibinden.com. 
2- The text drawn with line.py is fitted to the lines. For better analysis. 
3- Stopwords, word_tokenize, and PorterStemmer operations are performed on the data prepared with replace.py.

The continuation of the project is provided here for Jupyter -> data processing steps to be more understandable. 
4- Linear, lasso, xgboost, ridge and multivarient regressions were made with .ipynb extension files. 
5- At the end of the studies with prediction.ipynb, the application was predicted.
